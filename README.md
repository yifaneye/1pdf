## Background

I wanted to combine my lecture slides (several PDF files every week) into one PDF file, so that I can read, search, go back and forth while opening just one PDF file. ðŸ¤“

I used "https://combinepdf.com" at first, but it took me so long. ðŸ˜´ \
Most of that time was spent on uploading and downloading the PDF files, not the actual process of combining the PDF files. ðŸ˜ž

What if I can combine PDF files locally? That means no more time wasted on uploading and downloading the PDF files! ðŸ˜Ž ...

## Getting Started

Install the '1pdf' package globally using npm

```
npm i -g 1pdf
```

âœ…

OR \
when you do not have write access to /usr/local/lib/node_modules, run
```
sudo npm i -g 1pdf
```
enter password when prompted and hit enter/return

âœ…

## Usage

Step 1. ```cd``` into a directory containing PDF files to be combined

Step 2. (Optional) Rename the PDF files in your desired order

Step 3. Run
```
1pdf
```
to combine the PDF files into one PDF file

OR

Run
```
1pdf myFileName.pdf
```
to name the output PDF file at the same time
